This site is a landing page for a friend's pool business in Louisville, KY. I started this project from scratch to be his actually website but ultimately due to time constraints I decided to build it using Word Press. I continued the from scratch version for my project to test my skills. Since it will not be used I did not create additional pages to link to. I may complete that later to test my abilities with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I wanted something minimal and easy to navigate for the homepage so the user could see the information they wanted and navigate the site with ease on mobile and desktop.

Features:
1.	CSS - A Navigation Menu that expands and collapses at desktop and mobile sizes. Mine switches from vertical to horizontal from mobile to desktop to mobile/tablet view.
2.	CSS – Used the :nth-child CSS Feature to style the pool shape boxes borders.
3.	JavaScript – Used JS with a mathematical operation to create a countdown timer that shows the end of summer to users.
4.  CCS - Used FlexBox to manage the layout of multiple lists on the page.
